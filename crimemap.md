## Project Summary
We want to create a web application that can clearly display the crime. Users can use the website to report incidents they have seen as well as locate areas with high crime rates. With the use of this website, we want to reduce crime and improve student safety at UIUC.

## Project Description
Since the crime rate of Champaign and Urbana is almost the highest in Illinois, and UIUC students are the main victims, we decide to develop a web application that can help students and faculty to query and report crime in a map. In the map, Users can intuitively see what, when, where the crime happens in UIUC. 

Based on the data and artificial intelligence, the web can also predict where crime is most likely to occur, so that it can tell the police to raise the level of vigilance in that area, and also helps the public to avoid that area as much as possible. We hope both UIUC students and policemen can not only survive but also thrive in Champaign and Urbana.

## Realness
Our data will be the records of crime within UIUC campus and surrounding areas such as Champaign, Urbana, and Savoy. The best way for us to get our data is from police stations around those areas. That could only happen if they give us access to their database. If not, we might need to do some crawling from local newspapers. We hope to format our data to a table with attributes such as `CrimeId`, `Date`, `Address`, `TypeOfCrime`, and so on. 

## Usefulnesss

â€‹    Our program aims to build a map for students and faculties in UIUC to check crimes around and on campus. Our project will help people avoid meeting crime and have a safer campus life. This is useful especially for those who like going home late at night.

## Environment

### Crime_Map/client Folder
```
npx create-react-app
npm install react-router-dom 
npm install --save styled-components
npm install react-icons
npm install axios
npm i -S @react-google-maps/api
npm install react-date-range
npm install date-fns
npm install react-select
npm install --save react-geocode
```

### Crime_Map/server Folder
    npm install fs

## How to run

0. Set up the environment as above

1. Use your own google map api in Crime_Map/client/map.js. You need to use the api key for both geocode and google map.

2. Set up the database exactly the same as DatabaseDesign.md in google cloud SQL maching.

3. Connect the database in Crime_Map/server/index.js

4. In Crime_Map/client/ run

    npm start

5. In Crime_Map/server/ run

    node index.js
