## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="img/me.jpg" >

Hi! I am a master student of Computer Science at Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China. I'm fortunately supervised by [Prof. Ying Wang](https://wangying-ict.github.io/). Previously I got my bachelor degree at Zhejiang University and UIUC in 2024. My research interest is in LLM for hardware design right now.

In 2024, I spent a wonderful spring at Tiktok working on Tiktok recommendation system refactoring. I brought engineer and business metrics improvement on multiple Tiktok Apps.
