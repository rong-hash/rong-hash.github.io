## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="img/me.jpg" >

Hi! I am a senior year student of B.S. Electrical and Computer Engineering at Zhejiang University, China (GPA: 3.92/4, Rank: 3/64). I'm also an exchange student of Computer Engineering at UIUC, USA (GPA: 4/4). I'm fortunately supervised by [Prof. Ying Wang](https://wangying-ict.github.io/) at ICT (Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Science).  

In 2024, I spent a wonderful spring at Bytedance working on Tiktok recommendation system refactoring. I brought engineer and business metrics improvement on multiple Tiktok Apps.
